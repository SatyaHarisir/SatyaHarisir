-👋 Hi, I’m @SatyaHarisir
👀 I’m interested in English grammar, language learning, and education.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced language structures and linguistic theories.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to language education, grammar resources, or research in linguistics.
📫 How to reach me: [satyaharivissapragada@gmail.com].
😄 Pronouns: Sir
⚡ Fun fact: I once analyzed the grammar of a Shakespearean play for fun!
